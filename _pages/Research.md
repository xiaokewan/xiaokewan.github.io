[Routing in a Programmable Photonics Integrated Circuits](/assets/Final_Presentation.pptx) 
- Aiming at the single source single destination fixed pathlength routing problem, we proposed constrained-Dijkstra/DFS/A* and applied it to the hexagonal mesh programmable photonics circuits for routing ORRs and MZIs.
- Aiming to the single source multiple destinations fixed pathlength routing problem, we extend those methods also achieved by congestion negotiation mechanism.
- Aiming to the single source multiple destinations shortest pathlength routing problem, we applied CRoute and show the superiority in saving routing resources.
