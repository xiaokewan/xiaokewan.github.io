# ðŸ–¥ Experiences
- *2022.10 - now*, <span style="color:blue">Master Thesis: ***Routing in a Photonic Integrated Circuit*** 
  
  [csl](https://www.ugent.be/ea/elis/en/csl/home), [PRG](https://photonics.intec.ugent.be/) at UGent
  - Focus on multi-destinations routing algorithm on hexagon programmable photonics circuits.
   
- *2022.02 - 2022.06*, <span style="color:blue">Hardware Project: [***Sensor Matrix***](/assets/HOP06-Final Presentation.pdf)
  
  [CMST](https://www.cmst.be/) at UGent supervised by Prof. Pieter Bauwens and Dr. Herbert de Smet
  - Auto balancing bridge enable process sensor matrix signals faster by FFT. Circuits simulation, PCB design, and microprocessor programming are involved. 
    
- *2021.01 - 2021.06*, <span style="color:blue">Bachelor thesis: [***Electromyography Signal Processing***](/assets/EMG.pdf)
  
  [LS2N](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version/research/laboratory-of-digital-sciences-of-nantes-ls2n) at ECN supervised by Dr. Konstantin Akhmadeev
  
- *2019.09 - 2020.12*, <span style="color:blue">Research Assistant 
  
  [Institute of Flexible Electronics](https://ife.nwpu.edu.cn/English/News/News.htm) at NPU, supervised by [Prof. Qianbo Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wmF6mgQAAAAJ&hl=en).
  - Evolutionary algorithms especially Particle Swarm Optimization on MEMES applications.
  - ***Multiple Sub-swarm Collaborative Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Fusion Mechanism***, (under review), proposed a multiple sub-swarm collaborative PSO with an adaptive fusion mechanism (MSCPSO-AF) that blends the population partitioning, collaboration of sub-swarms, and adaptive fusion. Perform better than conventional swarm algorithms in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed.
  
- *2019.06 - 2019.07*, The University of British Columbia (UBC), Summer School, Communication and Digital Systems package with two courses:
  - Communication Systems: Technology Embedded in Daily life.
  - Introduction to Digital Systems Design with FPGAs.
